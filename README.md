## Create Your Own Flashcards

The questions in the example above are just placeholders. Itâ€™s easy to create your own questions:


1. Modify **data.js** with your own questions
    > The questions are loaded this way as a convenience so you can easily load index.html from the local file system
           (using the file:// protocol) without runnning into XHR cross origin issues. See the commented out componentDidMount
           in app.js for an alternative XHR implementation

2. Open **index.html**. You can just double-click **index.html** on your local file system: no need for a web server.
